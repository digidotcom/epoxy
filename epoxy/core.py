"""Epoxy core.

Note on logging: since Epoxy is typically used to launch an application,
and often define the logging *for* that application, we can't necessarily
enable standard Python logging to log from Epoxy itself.  The default
logging action (defined in `_default_log`) will be simply `print`; if
you wish to override this behavior, you could by setting
`epoxy.core.log = my_logging_function`.
